## Introduction

Our goal is to foster an open and welcoming environment for everyone interested in **Chat Visualizer**. Although we have not adopted a formal code of conduct framework at this time, we expect contributors to interact with respect and professionalism.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience, regardless of personal or professional background.

## Expected Behavior

- **Be Respectful**: Communicate respectfully and professionally with others.
- **Be Welcoming**: Encourage diverse perspectives, approaches, and opinions.
- **Be Constructive**: Give and receive feedback gracefully. When offering critique, be clear and offer suggestions.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, hate speech, discrimination, or any form of intimidation.
- Personal attacks or insults.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter behavior that you believe is not in line with these guidelines:

1. [Open an Issue](../../issues) describing the situation (if appropriate).
2. If you prefer to report privately, contact the maintainer via GitHub’s direct messaging (if enabled) or any alternative contact method shared in the repository.

## Enforcement

- Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards.
- Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
- Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the project.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including Issues, Pull Requests, and any other online or offline mediums where project communication takes place.

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate your cooperation in helping us create a respectful community. As the project evolves, we may adopt a more formal Code of Conduct and enforcement policy.

Thank you for supporting a friendly, positive environment for everyone involved in **Chat Visualizer**.
